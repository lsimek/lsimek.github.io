<p>My name is Luka and I am a mathematician focusing on statistics. I received my
undergraduate degree in mathematics in 2022. Currently I am working on personal projects and completing my graduate degree. I am particularly interested in statistical learning and its applications to statistical signal processing.
</p>

<p>
When programming I mainly use Python, both for its scientific libraries and general programming capabilities. I have experience with other scientific software like Matlab/Octave and R, DBMS' like PostgreSQL and Neo4j and C and C++ when it comes to implementing efficient algorithms.
